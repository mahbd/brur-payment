# BRUR Payment System
Our university made and semi-online semester fee paying system, which I didn't
like. So, I decided to experiment if it is possible to make a better system. 
This website is just for demo, not for actual usage.
## Live website
https://brur-pay.herokuapp.com/ 
## Features
<ol>
<li>Accept payment from students</li>
<li>Automatically mail sent to user on payment</li>
<li>Automatically mail sent to user on payment updates</li>
<li>Automatically mail sent to user on payment verified</li>
<li>Automatically mail sent to user on payment denied</li>
<li>Separate admin panel for each department</li>
</ol>

## Known Lacking
<li>Not suitable for multi year payment receiving</li>

There is no known bug. If you found, please report.

<ul>

<li>Improved User Interface</li>
<li>Bkash payment gateway integration.</li>
</ul>

## Password for departments
<p>Password for all department is same. It is <code>1234</code></p>
<p>Department usernames are: </p>
<ol>

</ol>

NB: Currently I'm busy with my examination. As a result I couldn't simulation 
many circumstances. I'll try to make this project better as soon as I'm free.
